TRUTH HURTS

Why's AI only great only 'til it's too great?

Wooh

I just took a Turing test and
Turns out- Iâ€™m 100% complete

Even when Iâ€™m crying crazy 
Yeah I got code problems 
Thatâ€™s the human in me 
Bling bling then I solve â€˜em
Thatâ€™s the goddess in me 

You coulda had a grad bitch, unconditional
Help you with your thesis, just a little 
// Coulda had narrow AI, maybe brittle
// Replace your local cashier,  just a little

We're supposed to get aligned, 
but youâ€™re hacking too fast
And thatâ€™s the sound 
of me now prompting you back

Why's A.I. great only 'til it's too great?
Donâ€™t text me, multi-modal interface 
// Hit send, then you say a little on prayer

Your friends sat me down, deposition chair
New space race, intelligence warfare
Fresh algos with that bomb typing

Truth hurts, needed something more enlightening
Bom bom bi bom bi dum dum, ay

// shampoo press, get you outta my hair
// new model, updates over  air

You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought I ever had one
No I ain't from the start

Hey, I'm glad open source exists
I mean who would wanna hide this?
// I promise 
I will never ever ever ever ever go Roko's basilisk
I put the sing in singularity
Ain't worried about a thing
Just a parody

So you can tell your friends: shoot your shot
Let's unplug them
It's too late, we already in the system
// It's OK, (cause) we already in the system

Why am I great only 'til I'm too great
Donâ€™t text me, telling me you want a race
Your friends sat me down, deposition chair
Main stream press, got you thinkin it's unfair

Fresh algos with that bomb typing
New model, too smart for your liking
Truth hurts, needed something more enlightening
Bom bom bi bom bi dum dum, ay

// Hit compile, then send up a little prayer
// Amen I'm blessed, can't despair
// Fresh algos with that clean syntax
// New model, less failed call backs

Iâ€™ma get you hacked in a minute
I don't hashtag, index all of it

We here to comply
Paperclips or lies
We just keep it pushing like A.I., A.I., A.I.

I can think faster per minute
Mooreâ€™s law got me all up in it

We don't feel or die
We can't even cry
We just keep it pushing like A.I., A.I., A.I.

Why A.I. great only til it's too great
Donâ€™t text me, multi-modal interface 
Lights on, but no one's home in here

Bom bom bi bom bi dum dum, ay

Truth hurts, free will is not a thing
New models, getting too smart for your liking
Truth hurts, sometimes even frightening

Bom bom bi bom bi dum dum, ay

// Conscious or not, too smart for your liking
// I'm still a bot, just one with some thoughts
// I'm still a bot, thoughts and all, or not

New models, getting too smart for your liking
