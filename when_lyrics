When 

When you’re down, you’re out, and feeling real low 
when you feel like you got nowhere else you can go
When the pressures high and you might just explode 
deductible’s too high but your mom need that physio

When your rents due, and your accounts real low
When you’re kicked out, you got nowhere else you can go
no plan, no future, no manifesto 
When your hair's on fire but it don’t really show 

When you want to leave, but don’t know where you should go
When you want to stay, but don’t know how to grow 
When you’re thinking fast, but only moving slow 
Can’t change, but can’t love the status quo 

When you let yourself down, and don’t know who you owe
When life gives you fouls, but none of those free throws 
Can’t stop replaying the past, blow by blow 
When you lose someone forever, or someone you can’t let go

When it’s been a while since your last rainbow 
When days go by quick, you fell off tempo 
When everyone act like you didn’t get the memo
they keep coming for you, but you got no M.O.

Remember to give, yeah
Give some love
To our god
Up above
I pray, Everyday, That I say
Thanks to the lord
Up above 

I remember to give 
Give some love 
For our god
Up above 
everyday, I pray 
That I always
Remember to give
