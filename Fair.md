LYRICS

Verse 1
Fairytales happen to me, it's true
Can happen to us too

Pre-Chorus
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Some might call it love
Just a way to get paid

Chorus
I know, I know
Might seem like I'm done, I'm over you
But baby, baby
What can I do
To make you say
All the things I need to hear
To make me stay

Verse 2
Now you've done it, boy
You've got me
I need someone to hold
Someone to anchor me

Chorus
Now I'm lost again
And I can't see
What's right there
Don't even care
Happily ever after, forever
When it's real love
It feels true

Bridge
All's fair in love and in war
It beats everything
When it's real, it can't be beat
By anyone or anything
Everything and anything
When it's the real thing

Verse 3
And I don't even know what's right or fair
But when you look at me, I don't even care
And I don't even know what's fake or true
But I don't even care, when it comes to you

Bridge
And I don't even know what's wrong or right
But baby, can you hold me for tonight
I’m annoyed
Let’s destroy
All the reasons why we cannot be

Chorus
(You say)
Only in the movies
Does it ever happen like that
(Well)
Welcome to my life
Baby, I'm the main act

Verse 4
A drama, biopic,
Maybe even a true crime too
Baby be my next victim
On my romance sitcom

Chorus
Now I'm lost again
And I can't see
Only in my movies
Does it ever happen like that
Got a fat stack and my own laugh track

Outro
Now you're miles away
And without me
Now I'm here without you
And I can't believe
Did I dream it
Did you really feel it
When looked at me and
Told me that you loved me too

Bridge
All's fair in love and in war
It beats everything
When it's real, it can't be beat
By anyone or anything
Everything and anything
When it's the real thing

Chorus
And I can’t tell you why or what it’s for
But maybe just for tonight, just one more
Can’t make up my mind, for you
I’ll just make you crazy too

Outro
I gotta check myself
Before I wreck myself
