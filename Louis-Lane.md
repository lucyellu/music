They also make a cloud of deadly dust 
Which falls slowly to the ground
This is what is called fall-out

And I don’t know why but every time I leave
I just can’t help but believe 
What she tells me, not just for the TV

And I know what they say about you and me
Blasphemy, practically a tragedy 

They say there's not enough decay 
not in this day just yet
For you to feel so betrayed
I must have been really played

And I don’t know why but every time I leave
I just can’t help but believe 
What she tells me, not just for the TV 

Blasphemy, practically a tragedy 

This is what is called fall-out

Made it 
Made it 
We made it 
Still can‘t get you off my mind 

We made it
Made it 
Made it 
Made it 
We made it
I still can‘t get you off my mind 

We made it 
Made it 
Made it
Made it 
We made it
But still got some things I got to find

And I don’t know why but every time I leave
I just can’t help but believe 
What she tells me, not just for the TV 

And I know what they say about you and me
Blasphemy, practically a tragedy 

They say there's not enough decay 
not in this day just yet
For you to feel so betrayed
I must have been really played

And I don’t know why but every time I leave
I just can’t help but believe 
What she tells me, not just for the TV 

Blasphemy, practically a tragedy 

This is what is called fall-out

We made it
Made it

We made it 
Still can‘t get you off my mind 

We made it
Made it 
Made it

I still can‘t get you off my mind 

We made it 
Made it

We made it
But still got some things I got to find
